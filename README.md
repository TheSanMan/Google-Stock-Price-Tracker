# Google-Stock-Price-Tracker

This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict Google stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Structure

- `Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv`: Training dataset containing historical stock prices.
- `Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv`: Test dataset for evaluating the model.
- `rnn.py`: Python script for training and evaluating the RNN model.
- `rnn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and experimentation.

## Project Overview

The RNN Stock Price Prediction project leverages the power of Recurrent Neural Networks to analyze time-series data of Google stock prices. The primary goal is to predict future stock prices based on historical trends. This type of model can be beneficial in various financial applications, including:

- **Algorithmic Trading**: Enhancing trading strategies by predicting stock price movements.
- **Investment Analysis**: Assisting investors in making informed decisions based on predicted stock trends.
- **Market Forecasting**: Providing insights into market behavior and potential future movements.

## Usage

**Using the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open the `rnn.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the code cells interactively.

## Data

- **Training Data**: `Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv`
- **Test Data**: `Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv`

## Model

The model is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras. It is designed to predict the next day's stock price based on previous historical data.
